`mul 2 2 $value` -> To multiply the first and second values.
`div 2 2 $value` -> To divide the first and second values.
`pow 2 2 $value` -> To power the first and second values.

#### OS:
To use OS library: `use os`
**Use**:
`mkdir diretory` -> To make diretory.
`mkfile file.txt` -> To make empty file.
